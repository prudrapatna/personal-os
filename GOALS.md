# Goals & Strategic Direction

*Last updated: November 22, 2025*

## Current Context

### What's your current role?
Product Manager at Google with the Health Team

### What's your primary professional vision? What are you building toward?
Build contextual, situational agents that will understand and reason on sensor data. In the next one year, I want to land 3 products and go for a promotion to group product manager.

I also want to focus more time on transformative things than just improvements or maintainance. My split should be 70% transformative,15% improvement and 15% maintenance. I am really inspired by this talk of Elon Musk https://youtu.be/T_zgtiOcZxI?si=OgkK60jrv9c71N2X  
I want to do something like this. I am spending less time on thinking and more time on maintainance and improvements. I want to do the opposite.

## Success Criteria

### In 12 months, what would make you think 'this was a successful year'?
I want to announce atleast 2 software as a medical device with Apnea and Breathing Emergency Detection. In addition I want to land research product for world model for human physiology that can do what if analysis given the current state of the user and predict the future state given an action a user takes.

### What's your 5-year north star? Where do you want to be?
I want to build contextual, situational agents that will understand and reason on sensor data. I want to be a thought leader in agentic AI and Physical AI. 

## Current Focus Areas

### What are you actively working on right now?
Health Sensing - Apnea, Breathing Emergency Detection, 

Sleep algorithms: Sleep Stages, Sleep Session, Sleep Need, Sleep score 2.0 

Waveform foundation model - early stages

### What are your objectives for THIS QUARTER (next 90 days)?
Start validation for apnea, carom, ensure sleep algorithms are in dogfood and develop world model concept with research team

### What skills do you need to develop to achieve your vision?
Learn to think big and transformative. Get better at 0-1 thinking. 

Think about doing less things and focus on the things that matter. 

More advanced AI concepts and adapting to product strategy

Prototyping and validating ideas

### What key relationships or network do you need to build?
I need to start prototying more, develop a presence where I add all my github repositories and share my work with the world. 

## Strategic Context

### What's currently blocking you or slowing you down?
I feel I am doing too many things. I am not that interested in the sleep algorithms or sleep apnea. 

### What opportunities are you exploring or considering?
I want to work on world model and use that as a way to develop more generalistic AI capabilities. 

## Priority Framework

**Transformation**
- Game-changers. New products, strategic breakthroughs, learning new skills. Things that move the needle exponentially.

**Optimization**
- Making existing systems better. Improving processes, reducing costs, fixing persistent problems.

**Maintenance**
- "Keeping the lights on." Emails, status meetings, reports, admin. Necessary but creates no new value.

When evaluating new tasks and commitments:

**P0 (Critical/Urgent)** - Must do THIS WEEK:
- Directly advances quarterly objectives and transformative
- Time-sensitive opportunities
- Critical stakeholder communication
- Immediate blockers to remove

**P1 (Important)** - This month:
- Builds key skills or expertise
- Advances product strategy
- Significant career development
- High-value learning opportunities

**P2 (Normal)** - Scheduled work:
- Supports broader objectives
- Maintains stakeholder relationships
- Operational efficiency
- General learning and exploration

**P3 (Low)** - Nice to have:
- Administrative tasks
- Speculative projects
- Activities without clear advancement value

## What are your top 3 priorities right now?

- Develop AI Product Skills 
- Prototype more 
- Finish clinical validation for apnea and carom
